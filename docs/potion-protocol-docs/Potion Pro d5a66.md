# Potion Protocol

Potion Protocol is a scalable price-insurance AMM developed for the Ethereum eco-system. The protocol enables permissionless insurance for crypto-assets, with customisable strike prices and durations. 

The protocol is based on the mathematical principles of the Kelly Criterion, to ensure long-term survival for LPs, even when insuring fat-tailed crypto assets.
