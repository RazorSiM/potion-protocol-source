# Getting Started

Users must first decide if they are interested in Buying or Selling Options.

1. **[Buyers](Buyers%20Use%20c2ca5.md)** 

Buyers are users that want to hedge their risk against future price changes that may otherwise result in portfolio loses. They do this by buying Potions (options).

2. **[Liquidity Providers (LPs)](Liquidity%20%204051b.md)** 

LPs are users that want to earn yield on their assets. To do this they create and fund Liquidity Pools that sell Potions to Buyers.
